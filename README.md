Nlighten is a simple knowledge sharing/webinar platform showcasing modern development technologies.

## goals

Main goal of Nlighten is to provide a simple modern platform to host online workshops, courses and webinars.
Our objectivers are:

* Built solid, scalabale platform that is easy to distribute and run using docker
* Enable rich interactive live events over the internet, with content sharing, Q&A, presenter controls,etc
* Nice and user friendly UI 
* Showcase modern development workflow
* Showcase productive and performant Java based backend technologies & modern frontend frameworks

## documentation

At the moment, the project is in a very early stage, therefore most documentation is intended for developers.  
Purpose of the dev documentation is to provide relevant up-to-date info on non-trivial topics. We do that by following these simple rules:

* all documentation is to be stored in markdown files inside '/docs' subfolder
* prefer brief, informative sentences to lengthy prose
* always update the docs, if you change important parts of the app
* make sure that source code comments(javadoc) make sense - do not comment trivial methods(getters,setters)

## installation

TODO  
Goal is to have everything ready as a simple docker image
